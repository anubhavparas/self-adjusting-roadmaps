# Self-adjusting roadmaps for unknown environments

##### Following are the instructions to run the code:
- In the terminal where you can run python scripts go to the directory where the above files are located
- Make sure you have numpy installed. *[help](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/install.html)*
- For running the main code:  Type: **$ python main.py**
- Follow the input instructions that will appear once the scripts are executed.

##### Sample input test cases:
Initial position (x y): -2 -2
Initial Orientation (in degrees): 30
Target position (x y):  4 4
Clearance required (in meters, recommended: 0 to 0.35m): 0


Initial position (x y): -2.54 -3
Initial Orientation (in degrees): 20
Target position (x y):  4 4
Clearance required (in meters, recommended: 0 to 0.35m): 0
